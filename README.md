iPhone Application - Learning Times Table

An iPhone Objective-C application started in 2008 focusing on helping children learn their times table. The emphasis was on tracking how well the child was doing, issuing awards and reporting to the parent the progress.  This implementation is incomplete as I redirected my effort into a Unity3D based version.
